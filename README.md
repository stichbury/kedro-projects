# Jo's kedro-projects repository

This repo stores a set of Kedro projects that I have put together to test/document/illustrate features of Kedro. I use it mostly for my own understanding as I'm writing/editing documentation, but it's also available for anyone who needs to check out an example that we haven't published "officially" as part of the Kedro project.

So far, it contains the following:

* Spaceflights project for 0.18.3 with an additional reporting pipeline
